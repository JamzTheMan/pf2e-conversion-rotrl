## A Foundry VTT module containing PF2e conversions for Rise of the Runelords PF2e Conversion

### *This is an Unofficial conversion...*

Based on work done by volunteers at [A Series of Dice Based Events - RiseOfTheRunelords](https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords)
For more information or to contribute, join us in the [A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H).

### To manually install this module, use this URL as the manifest:

https://github.com/JamzTheMan/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/releases/latest/download/module.json

*Note: This module only contains Compendium Packs and can be turned off after importing any scenes or actors you want/need into your world, but you should leave it installed if you imported any scenes or used any artwork from the module folder.*

Currently, this module is updated to work with Foundy VTT v9.x and includes:
 * All Converted NPC's plus a couple of variants
 * A few loot actors for Chapter 3 & 4
 * Most Scenes (with walls and lights) for Chapters 3-4
 * A LOT of extra artwork and alternate maps. Everyone has different tastes and some community created content has been lost over the last decade but a few of us have tried to collect and preserve it. After installing the module, look in `modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images` folder.

Some scenes that I used for Chapters 3 & 4 had to be omitted because official images from Paizo were used to run those scenes but you fill find most of the major scenes ready to run, just drop actors from the compendiums.

What you will not find are journal entries for room text or chapter background info as that would not be OGL. You will also need to find art for all the NPC's for the same reason.

I have spun up a data entry world to host this module and if you would like to fill in the gaps like missing scene or actors, hit me up on discord.

TODO:
 * Journal entries for Jorgenfist infiltration Subsystem & The Ancient Library Subsystem by Lawrencelot#3356
 * Macro or some method to include actors placed on scenes, maybe...
