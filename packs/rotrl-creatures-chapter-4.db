While they are most famous for appearing as wizened, bearded men, redcap women are no less fearsome or cruel. Redcaps are ultimately craven bullies, cowed by anything more powerful than themselves, a trait that leads them to fear and despise the symbols of good deities. Many fairy tales explain how the redcaps draw power from dipping the hats for which they are named in fresh blood. Just as iconic to these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging sound of their metal soles clanking on stone floors is both discordant and disconcerting- especially to those who recognize the sound for what it is. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with hunched frames, pointed ears, crooked teeth, and long, white, tangled hair.<br /><br

Taiga giants are happiest when they are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so.<br /><br /> Taiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They occasionally raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than malicious, with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people. Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are scheduled to come close.<br /><br /> Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in everything they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of those legacies, and little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly than insulting their ancestors. Merely mentioning the false rumors that ancient taiga giant spellcasters were responsible for the creation of the first rune giants is a surefire way to earn a taiga giant's unending wrath.<br /><br /> A taiga giant stands 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.<br /><br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"}},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, see invisibility"},"traits":{"value":["giant","humanoid"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","jotun"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["controlled"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.649,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-08-05T16:43:03.801-05:00","version":{"schema":0.646,"foundry":"0.8.8","system":"2.11.0.7242"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":7,"min":3,"value":24},"dex":{"mod":1,"min":3,"value":12},"con":{"mod":5,"min":3,"value":20},"int":{"mod":1,"min":3,"value":12},"wis":{"mod":4,"min":3,"value":18},"cha":{"mod":2,"min":3,"value":14}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":25,"saveDetail":"","ability":"con","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0},"reflex":{"value":20,"saveDetail":"","ability":"dex","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0},"will":{"value":22,"saveDetail":"","ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"actorId":"W1OXnXGF22uybovO","actorLink":false,"alpha":1,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":50,"displayName":30,"disposition":-1,"flags":{},"height":3,"img":"modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images/sihedron-rune.webp","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":0,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":true,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"name":"Taiga Giant","randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":0,"tint":null,"vision":true,"width":3,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"FRON78Ldl5DmbpeP","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This very long spear, sometimes called a pike, is purely for thrusting rather than throwing.

When the plant senses the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.</p>\n<p>Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots.

With their abnormally gaunt frames, long white hair, and unnerving, four-fingered hands, shining children are both strangely familiar and otherworldly in appearance, though they are barely visible within the shroud of blinding light they continually emit. Their faces are truly horrible, however, as their overlarge eyes and distended, gaping mouths reveal their heads to be voids filled with unnatural light. Shining children use this light as a weapon, weaving illusions and focusing beams of fiery brilliance.<br /><br /> Because of their reputation as scholars of the alien and the eldritch, shining children are sometimes summoned by powerful wizards or occultists in search of rare knowledge. The creatures never give away their lore without some price, though, and typically demand in return the performance of contemptible deeds that further their inscrutable, far-ranging plans.<br /><br /> These mysterious beings are natives of the Astral Plane. In that vast plane, accretions of metaphysical matter gradually accumulate and eventually coalesce into demiplanes. During this tumultuous process, sparks of living light sometimes shear off the newly formed planes, and these sparks of raw planar energy somehow transform into shining children. Every newly formed demiplane leaves a different mental imprint on its shining &quot;offspring,&quot; making it easy for shining children to telepathically recognize their brothers and sisters. Forever trapped in apparently adolescent bodies, shining children dedicate themselves to scholarship and violence with equal measure in a futile effort to understand their roles in the multiverse and the burning injustice of their births.<br /><br /> Shining children confuse most other creatures with their refusal to use individual names in favor of alternating between referring to each other singularly and collectively.<br /><br />","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"traits":{"value":["astral","elite"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["aklo","custom"],"selected":[],"custom":"telepathy 120 feet"},"di":{"value":["blinded","dazzled","fire"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.708,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-12-27T11:14:15.734-06:00","version":{"schema":0.701,"foundry":"9.238","system":"3.1.1.9568"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":2},"dex":{"mod":5},"con":{"mod":6},"int":{"mod":2},"wis":{"mod":5},"cha":{"mod":7}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":22,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":1,"img":"modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images/sihedron-rune.webp","name":"Shining Child","width":1,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":1000,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":60,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":3,"intensity":4,"type":"wave"},"displayBars":50,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"splatter":{"bloodColor":""},"monks-little-details":{"bloodsplat-colour":""},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"lightColor":"#f2f2f2","x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"e8bdyFJ6ae9JPTZ2","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.708,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-12-27T11:14:15.734-06:00","version":{"schema":0.701,"foundry":"9.238","system":"3.1.1.9568"}}},"ability":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"value":23,"dc":"33","mod":0,"item":0},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":false},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot1":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot2":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot3":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"displayLevel":{},"item":{"value":0}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"RsoBJBwjAc2cvQLE","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This abjuration reflects spells cast at you back at their caster.

As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern's resilient body allows it to crash talons-first into large prey without serious risk to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before it descends to pick apart the carcass.<br /><br /> Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment, and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks before the wyvern's pride, malice, or insolence inspires it to flee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid helping others.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"}},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"traits":{"value":["dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["paralyzed","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.649,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-08-05T16:43:03.783-05:00","version":{"schema":0.646,"foundry":"0.8.8","system":"2.11.0.7242"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6,"min":3,"value":22},"dex":{"mod":3,"min":3,"value":16},"con":{"mod":4,"min":3,"value":18},"int":{"mod":-2,"min":3,"value":6},"wis":{"mod":3,"min":3,"value":16},"cha":{"mod":1,"min":3,"value":12}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":16,"saveDetail":"","ability":"con","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"base":20},"reflex":{"value":12,"saveDetail":"","ability":"dex","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"base":16},"will":{"value":13,"saveDetail":"","ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"base":17}}},"token":{"actorId":"wuaSG22lLjQ6yali","actorLink":false,"alpha":1,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":50,"displayName":30,"disposition":-1,"flags":{"splatter":{"bloodColor":""}},"height":2,"img":"modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images/sihedron-rune.webp","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":0,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":true,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"name":"Wild Wyvern","randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":0,"tint":null,"vision":true,"width":2,"lightColor":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"s5DYWIxSytUTy1x2","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.649,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-08-05T16:43:03.783-05:00","version":{"schema":0.646,"foundry":"0.8.8","system":"2.11.0.7242"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"7erb2kw38fpwxhwon5hv":{"damage":"2d10+9","damageType":"piercing"}},"bonus":{"value":21,"total":21},"attackEffects":{"value":[]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Fangs","sort":100000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"Ptn3Zb1Syk7YdL4y","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.649,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-08-05T16:43:03.783-05:00","version":{"schema":0.646,"foundry":"0.8.8","system":"2.11.0.7242"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"lcwldz6jeqddoylsq1zx":{"damage":"2d8+8","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":21,"total":21},"attackEffects":{"value":["Grab"]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Claw","sort":200000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"SPTwJf1wzeADk4sn","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","reach-10"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.649,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-08-05T16:43:03.783-05:00","version":{"schema":0.646,"foundry":"0.8.8","system":"2.11.0.7242"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"crn2lrrh68exgyi0ieuv":{"damage":"2d6+7","damageType":"piercing"}},"bonus":{"value":19,"total":19},"attackEffects":{"value":["wyvern venom"]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Stinger","sort":300000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"ke061cBViYyPq54H","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. <strong>Effect</strong> The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature.

The secondary caster attempting the Crafting check creates a warding diagram to prevent the extraplanar creature from attacking or leaving during the bargain; if that caster fails or critically fails, then instead of the usual effects of a failure or critical failure of the secondary skill check, the extraplanar creature can attack or leave instead of negotiate. You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good extraplanar creature you trust, for example). The creature can also attack or leave if you use any hostile action against it or if the warding diagram breaks.

A creature that doesn't wish to negotiate at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most good and neutral extraplanar creatures feel that they have something better to do than cater to the whims of mortals and require a significant gift, especially if your task poses significant risks. Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you.
