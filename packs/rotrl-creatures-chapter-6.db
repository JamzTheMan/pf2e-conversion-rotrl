Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet"},"traits":{"value":["dragon","electricity"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["auran","common","draconic","jotun"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["electricity","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":4},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":24,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":23,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":23,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":3,"img":"modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images/sihedron-rune.webp","name":"Adult Blue Dragon","width":3,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"ttFxkO2qOIlHaSJc","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":null},"ability":{"value":"cha"},"spelldc":{"value":25,"dc":33,"mod":0},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"prepared":{"value":"innate","flexible":false},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot1":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot2":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot3":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"jqi7VsBT7VaIDlXD","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You create an illusory image of a Large or smaller creature.

You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.</p>\n<p>In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell.

If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There, they capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or punishments and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters. These horrifying predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of the River of Souls in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims. Psychopomps have a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes between them and these eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff of legend.</p>\n<p>Not all astradaemons limit their hunt to souls. The most notorious of their kind serve the Horsemen themselves as assassins.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Denizens of the bleak and terrible plane of Abaddon, daemons are shaped by and devoted to the destruction of life in all its forms. They seek the death of every mortal being by the most painful and horrible means possible, all in service to the apocalyptic entities known as the Four Horsemen. Each kind of daemon represents a different way to die, and their powers are nearly always aimed at spreading that particular form of death. Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion.</p>\n<p>While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures' destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals' fear.</p>\n<p>While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods-not least of which is the cacodaemons' soul gems-to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual \"resource.\"</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, lifesense 30 feet; true seeing"},"traits":{"value":["daemon","fiend"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","daemonic"],"selected":[],"custom":"Telepathy 100 feet"},"di":{"value":["death-effects","negative"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"type":"good","value":15}],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":6},"con":{"mod":7},"int":{"mod":2},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":7}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":27,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":30,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":26,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":2,"img":"modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images/sihedron-rune.webp","name":"Astradaemon","width":2,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"Rxv5Fh6XLsy8yyXk","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":null},"ability":{"value":"cha"},"spelldc":{"value":29,"dc":37,"mod":0},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"prepared":{"value":"innate","flexible":false},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot1":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot2":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot3":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"5FKUScxZ5gknMB7j","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You learn the name of the target's exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence.

During the casting, choose a trigger under which the spell will be cast, using the same restrictions as for the trigger of a Ready action. Once contingency is cast, you can cause the companion spell to come into effect as a reaction with that trigger. It affects only you, even if it would affect more creatures. If you define complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger might fail.

This persistent haunt plays out over 11 rounds, following a scripted series of actions. Allow the PCs to take their own actions as they wish each round; the haunt's actions always occur on initiative count 10.</p>","reset":"<p>1 minute</p>","routine":"<ul>\n<li><strong>Round 1-3</strong>: Allow the PCs to each make a @Check[type:perception|dc:35] check. Anyone who succeeds hears a faint knocking coming from the lower portion of the cabin, probably the outer door at area B3, as if some lost traveler were seeking shelter from the storm. PCs in the lower rooms of the cabin or the stair shaft need only succeed at a @Check[type:perception|dc:25]&nbsp;check to hear this knocking. The knocking continues for 3 rounds, during which time PCs might head down to see whom it might be. Attempts to see the ground outside the cabin are fruitless due to the whirling snow flurries, unless the PCs are within 5 feet, and then they still see nothing present that could have caused the knocking.</li>\n<li><strong>Round 4</strong>: The strange knocking grows silent for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>Round 5</strong>: A loud crack followed by a mighty hammering sound suddenly fills the cabin as its walls begin to shake and groan, almost as if the structure were giving up its purchase on the cliff edge and sliding off. On each turn that a PC remains in the haunt's area, he must make a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:36] check; failure indicates he cannot move for that round, while failure by 5 or more indicates he falls @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}. A character in area B6 at this time falls off the stairs if he falls @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}.</li>\n<li><strong>Round 6</strong>: The hammering continues, but now the faint images of starving dwarven ghosts can be glimpsed out of the corner of the eye. Each character suddenly experiences painful hunger pangs and must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:36] save to resist taking [[/r {4d6}[nonlethal]]]{4d6 nonlethal Damage} and become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued} from the horrific hunger.</li>\n<li><strong>Round 7</strong>: Voices can now be heard, in most cases wordless cries of pain, but now and then snatches of sentences like <em><strong>&ldquo;eating us...\"</strong></em> or <em><strong>\"don't let him...\"</strong></em> or <em><strong>\"so hungry....\"</strong></em> The hammering continues, but now the starving ghosts seem to notice the PCs for the first time. Each PC must make a @Check[type:will|dc:36] save - failure indicates that the haunt possesses him as the ghosts themselves seem to flow into the PC's body. Possession causes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} for 1 minute, and has additional implications in rounds 8-10.</li>\n<li><strong>Round 8-10</strong>: For the last 3 rounds of this complex haunt, the shaking and hammering continues. Characters possessed by the haunt do not need to make Acrobatics checks to move and take whatever actions they can to render non-possessed characters unconscious or helpless, using whatever tools they have at their disposal. If a possessed character is adjacent to a helpless, non-possessed character and is not threatened by any other non-possessed character, he attempts a full round of attacks against the helpless character with the best weapon option he has. If a possessed character is adjacent to a dead character, he feeds on the body and takes no other actions unless he is attacked by someone else.</li>\n<li><strong>Round 11</strong>: With a sudden lurch, the haunting stops. Possessed characters immediately regain control of their faculties. Any character who successfully fed on an ally must make a @Check[type:will|dc:36] save upon realizing what he's done - failure results in an additional level of Stupefied from the supernaturally fueled revelation and the condition now lasts 1 day. The cabin itself shows no signs of damage from the violence aside from anything the PCs themselves have done to it.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

Yetis who guard these portals sometimes succumb to these horrors and are corrupted, taking on the bloodthirsty urges and horrific behaviors of the very monsters they strive to protect the world against. Yetis who manifest such violent tendencies are driven out of their clan and forced to wander the mountaintops alone, thus giving rise to the myth of the legendary abominable snowman. Forced to fend for themselves, these exiled yetis often fully embrace the corrupting elements that caused their exile in the first place, growing more powerful and more deadly as a result. The most vile of these yetis turn to cannibalism, not out of need, but out of a sheer joy at the terror they inflict upon their kin. Invariably such cannibalistic yetis attract the attention of wendigos, which makes a bad situation all the worse.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"traits":{"value":["humanoid"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["aklo"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"type":"fire","value":10}],"ci":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"lg"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":7},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-1},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":-1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":25,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":21,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":22,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":2,"img":"modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images/sihedron-rune.webp","name":"Yeti","width":2,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"ui6XZl3S0T45fJFu","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","reach-10"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":null},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"id9amtipbu9a537ku8ua":{"damage":"3d12+19","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":24},"attackEffects":{"value":["rend"],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":100000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"qaf6YFqcLoAJ5CM4","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hiding}, the yeti is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} by any snowfall, even if it's not thick enough to make other creatures concealed.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":null},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Snowblind","sort":200000,"type":"action","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"eoHwXTgs9Au82i4J","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Yetis gain a +4 status bonus to saves against fear and against spells and abilities that affect dreams.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious
