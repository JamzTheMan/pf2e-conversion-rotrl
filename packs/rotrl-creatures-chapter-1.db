one of seven sins. The first sinspawn was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn't long before the technique used to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn's bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn's veins appear to run with gold while envyspawn appear even more wasted than the rest of their kin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The most commonly encountered of the sinspawn.

rank-and-file brutes who make up the bulk of an orc warband.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Orcs are violent, monstrous humanoids that live by the rule that might makes right. They amass in brutal warbands both large and small, decimating and robbing those unlucky enough to cross their path. Countless small settlements, outposts, and forts have fallen at the hands of orc raiders, whose fecundity and sheer destructiveness leave an indelible mark on the lands they conquer. Survivors of orc invasions are as likely to be fed to the orcs' war beasts as they are to be taken as slaves. Unspeakable atrocities await any outsiders brought back to orc encampments, and to many, death is a far more preferable outcome compared to capture by orcs.</p>\n<p>Physically, orcs tower over most humanoids and look practically custom-made for violence with their rough flesh, sturdy bone, and iron-hard muscle. For all their tough looks, however, orcs are far from invincible. They lack the discipline to conduct large-scale campaigns, for one thing, and they typically lose their heads in the heat of battle. Even their skin scars easily-though this is a source of pride to the orc people, since scars signify strength and experience in battle. To orcs, the crisscross of old wounds are a much a badge of pride and honor as any beheaded foe or claimed trophy.</p>\n<p>Orcs are a people of violent passions in all that they do, not just war. Bonds of blood are especially strong among orcs, and lineage is important. The strongest orc bands are typically made up of brothers and sisters in more than arms; orcs fight harder when they are protecting their own kinsfolk, and orc warriors will fight tirelessly to avenge fallen family members. This emphasis on bloodlines is not an altruistic one, however, and is in fact a double-edged sword. Orcs whose families have been killed find themselves at the bottom of the clan's totem pole, and even a famous chieftain can become powerless overnight if their brethren aren't there to back them up.</p>\n<p>The chaotic and fractious nature of orc culture results in a great variety of beliefs, superstitions, and legacies among different clans. This cultural divergence causes substantial infighting among orc bands, in many cases preventing the rise of larger orc nations. It can also frustrate many attempts at diplomacy, as the taboos of one band may be commonplace and thoroughly accepted practices among others. Navigating a specific band's culture can often mean the difference between life and death to those who deal with orcs off the field of war. Although orcs, as a rule, rarely deal with outsiders, they recognize the benefits of trade and willingly swap resources with other violent peoples like hobgoblins, drow, and many humans.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["human","humanoid"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["orcish"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.813,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-01-11T11:04:35.430-06:00","version":{"schema":0.719,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.6.5"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":3},"int":{"mod":-1},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":4,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":2,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"USyNCCBYkl6altwM":3},"prototypeToken":{"disposition":-1,"height":1,"name":"Ven Vinder","width":1,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true,"autoscale":true},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null}},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images/sihedron-rune.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1673456676276,"modifiedTime":1673457000933,"lastModifiedBy":"ZFGymRexiCVeiXzz"}}

Of course, being goblins, they haven't bothered to come up with their own, unique name for goblin dogs.</p>\n<p>Even the most pampered goblin dogs have itchy mange and prolific dander that tenaciously affects those who come in contact with them. This \"goblin pox\" causes itchy hives and festering sores that are as unsightly as they are irritating and distracting. Goblin dog dander causes allergic reactions in nearly all other creatures that don't share the goblin dogs' terrible hygiene-with the notable exception, of course, of goblins, who remain entirely immune to the disease regardless of cleanliness.</p>\n<p>Hunger can drive goblin dogs to bouts of uncharacteristic violence; many goblins purposefully starve their pets to make them more aggressive in battle. Goblin dogs subsist on whatever organic material they can scavenge, and they particularly enjoy fresh carrion. Although goblins are far from picky eaters, they value goblin dogs as pets because the noisome animals will consume food that even goblins won't dare to eat. \"Will it eat?\" is one of several games goblins enjoy playing with their goblin dog pets, where a wide range of mouth-sized morsels (not always edible or safe to consume) are dangled before a goblin dog's snout. \"Will it die?\" is often a game played after \"Will it eat?\" Goblin dogs who survive the second game earn renown for their digestive prowess and often become favored tribal pets treated better than most of the rank-and-file goblins.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.813,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-01-11T11:04:35.442-06:00","version":{"schema":0.719,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.6.5"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":-1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":8,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":8,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":5,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"USyNCCBYkl6altwM":3},"prototypeToken":{"disposition":-1,"height":1,"name":"Goblin Dog","width":1,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true,"autoscale":true},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null}},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images/sihedron-rune.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1673456676279,"modifiedTime":1673457000935,"lastModifiedBy":"ZFGymRexiCVeiXzz"}}

Found in freshwater inlets or saltwater coves worldwide, bunyips hunt where prey is plentiful, often to the consternation of coastal residents and fisherfolk.</p>\n<p>Despite their outlandish appearance and tendency to defend their territory with loud, bellowing roars that echo for great distances, bunyips are very rarely sighted by humanoids, leaving many to question their existence. For hundreds of years, bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression.</p>\n<p>In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the chum and garbage discarded by fishing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal","aquatic"],"senses":{"value":"blood scent, darkvision, scent (imprecise) 100 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.813,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-01-11T11:04:35.534-06:00","version":{"schema":0.719,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.6.5"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":-1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"USyNCCBYkl6altwM":3},"prototypeToken":{"disposition":-1,"height":1,"name":"Bunyip","width":1,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true,"autoscale":true},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null}},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/pf2e-conversion-rotrl/images/sihedron-rune.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1673456676296,"modifiedTime":1673457000946,"lastModifiedBy":"ZFGymRexiCVeiXzz"}}

Often adored as pets, they also excel as protectors and trackers, and can be fearless when defending a beloved master or family member. The statistics presented below work well for any number of breeds of dog ranging from 20 to 50 pounds in weight. Wild dogs can also use these statistics, but their untamed nature makes them far more unpredictable and threatening. Feral dogs are perhaps even more dangerous, for unlike their wild cousins, feral dogs often lack the instinctual fear of humanity that stops wild creatures from interacting with people.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dogs are trusted and loyal companions that serve as guardians, protectors, and hunting companions. Their ability to detect prey or predators via scent and their predilection to accompany humanoids makes them ideal pets for most adventurers. There are hundreds of breeds of dogs in the world-from tiny lapdogs who shower their masters in affection to muscular dogs that stand nearly 4 feet high at the shoulder-and they can be found in nearly any place where people reside. Larger breeds might even be used as mounts for smaller adventurers, and some cultures use dogs as beasts of burden capable of pulling sleds loaded with supplies across the icy tundra.

Yeth hounds resemble lean, sleek dogs with overlarge ears and narrow paws that can tread on air as easily as the ground. Despite their canine appearance, yeth hounds are remarkably intelligent, although they rarely display this intelligence except when devising intricate tactics to ensnare their quarry. Their eerie bays echo across the countryside when they are engaged in a hunt, and they particularly enjoy baying to frighten and disorient intelligent creatures. Yeth hound packs can number as many as a dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from the hounds' previous meals.</p>\n<p>Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their prey. Yeth hounds usually attack wargs, wolves, and similar creatures on sight, working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when then can't simply overpower and kill them.</p>\n<p>Evil rangers, bestial demons, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound servants by fiendish patrons.

During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.</p>\n<p>In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities.
